## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It supports two players taking turns to mark cells in a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Allows two players to compete turn by turn.  
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the player chooses a valid and unoccupied cell.  
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically detects and declares the winner or a tie.  
- **Clean Game Loop**: Simplifies game flow with clear functions for turns, winner checks, and player flipping.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns selecting a position (1â€“9) to mark their symbol (X or O).  
2. The board positions are as follows:  
   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   4 | 5 | 6
   7 | 8 | 9
   ```  
3. The game ends when:  
   - A player aligns three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (Winner).  
   - All cells are filled, but no alignment is achieved (Tie).
